## Collaborative Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS) for Individuals with Sex Chromosome Trisomies (SCT) --- FinnGen data freeze 10

### Step 1: Define SCT in males (XXY and XYY) and females (XXX) based on SNP array intensity data


### Step 2: Generate Phecodes from health registers (ICD9 and ICD10)


### Step 3: Match 5 controls for each case


### Step 4: Run case-control pheWAS using conditional logistic regression


### Step 5: Meta-analysis and heterogeneity test across three cohorts


### Step 6: Visualization
#### 6.1 PheWAS manhattan plots for each type of SCT
#### 6.2 Comparison: males with an extra X versus males with an extra Y 
#### 6.3 Comparison: males with an extra X versus females with an extra X
