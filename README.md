# Collaborative Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS) in Individuals with Sex Chromosome Trisomies (SCT) --- FinnGen data freeze 10

# Step 1: Define SCT in males (XXY and XYY) and females (XXX) based on SNP array intensity data


# Step 2: Generate Phecodes from health registers


# Step 3: Matched case-control pheWAS


# Step 4: Meta-analysis across three cohorts


# Step 5: Visualization
## (1) PheWAS manhattan plots for each type of SCT
## (2) Comparison: males with an extra X versus males with an extra Y 
## (3) Comparison: males with an extra X versus females with an extra X
